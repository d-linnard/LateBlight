## Late blight forecasts for the Columbia Basin of Washington
The goal of this page is to help potato growers in the Columbia Basin of Washington make informed decisions about late blight management. Here we present forecasts and recommendations. The forecasts are derived from models developed by [Johnson *et al*. 1998](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1094/PDIS.1998.82.6.642), [Johnson *et al*. 2009](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1094/PDIS-93-3-0272) & [Johnson and Cummings 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12230-016-9500-1). Each week, we will post probabilities of annual late blight outbreaks along with recommendations for Othello, Prosser and Tri-Cities.

###  Forecasts and Recommendations for May 20th 2022
#### Forecasts:

| Location | P(outbreak) |
| :---: | :---: |
| Othello | 0.81 |
| Prosser | 0.96 |
| Tri-Cities | 0.53 |

#### Recommendations:

* Eliminate culls, tuber refuse, and volunteer potato plants, especially in fields with or near late blight last year.
* Monitor fields for late blight. This is very important for (i) effective management and (ii) accurate forecasting. Growers, field representatives, and extension agents serve as the eyes on the ground. We need this information to provide meaningful forecasts.
