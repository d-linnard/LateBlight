#### Recommendations:

* Eliminate culls, tuber refuse, and volunteer potato plants, especially in fields with or near late blight last year.
* Monitor fields for late blight. This is very important for (i) effective management and (ii) accurate forecasting. Growers, field representatives, and extension agents serve as the eyes on the ground. We need this information to provide meaningful forecasts.
