## Late blight forecasts for the Columbia Basin of Washington
The goal of this page is to help potato growers in the Columbia Basin of Washington make informed decisions about late blight management. Here we present forecasts and recommendations. The forecasts are derived from models developed by [Johnson *et al*. 1998](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1094/PDIS.1998.82.6.642), [Johnson *et al*. 2009](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1094/PDIS-93-3-0272) & [Johnson and Cummings 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12230-016-9500-1). Each week, we will post probabilities of annual late blight outbreaks along with recommendations for Othello, Prosser and Tri-Cities.

###  Forecasts and Recommendations for July 30th 2021
#### Forecasts:

| Location | P(outbreak) |
| :---: | :---: |
| Othello | 0.34 |
| Prosser | 0.002 |
| Tri-Cities | 0.77 |

#### Recommendations:

* Eliminate culls, tuber refuse, and volunteer potato plants, especially in fields with or near late blight last year.
* Monitor fields for late blight. This is very important for (i) effective management and (ii) accurate forecasting. Growers, field representatives, and extension agents serve as the eyes on the ground. We need this information to provide meaningful forecasts.
* Although late blight has not yet been detected, below are our typical recommendations for this time of year when the disease is present. Apply fungicides on a 14 day schedule and before any rainy periods.Watch the 10-day weather forecasts for rain and apply a fungicide 1 to 7 days before any major rainfall.
